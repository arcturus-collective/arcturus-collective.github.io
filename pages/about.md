At the Arcturus Collective, our mission is to develop games and develop game
technology for indie developers. We embrace unusual and weird ideas in our
creative game development process. We are committed to empowering workers and
establishing a diverse and equitable environment for independent game
development. Through the sharing of ideas and knowledge with fellow workers and
the community, we hope to foster cooperation and innovation.
